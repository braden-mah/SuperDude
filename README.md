A 2D stickman platforming game where users can build and play their own levels.  

IMPORTANT: In order to run the jar file and play the game, you will need to have a JRE installed on your computer.  If you do not have a JRE installed, please go to oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html to get one!  

In a future update, I plan to add a bundled JRE so that users will not have to go through this hassle.  

Built with Processing and Eclipse Java.
